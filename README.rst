Timeline Tools
==================================================
Timeline Tools provides and EDL and a Timecode module combined in the timeline package.

The original comment lines in the edl and timecode module were very short and both still lack documentation.
They were initially written for the VFX pipeline build for the Dutch feature film Minoes and further used in
later VFX production pipelines. As such the focus allways has been just the correct functioning of a particular
use case.

Still it contains a more or less general usable edl and timecode. The edl class has as a lot of attributes
usually not present in EDL's. The edl concept was freely used to convey any thing time line related and
generally not used by standard software applications such as Avid, Final Cut, Premiere, daVinci Resolve and other
high end grading software.

More or less general since the edl module is really bad on the speeds and effects side of edl's and audio was
completely ignored when writing the module and has never been required over the years it's been used in other
production pipelines.

Allthough I long had the intention to put it into the public domain it just never happened until this year
a student production desperately could use it's function to build their own edit update tools to daily deliver an
updated timeline of their film. I hope to add these to this repository shortly with permission of the author.

The other goal is to add at least a bit of documentation and examples. For now you'll have to just read the code
to get started.

There are a bunch of other EDL and Timecode related projects to be found here on github each of which if worth
checking out as there are diffent takes and solutions for each problem.
